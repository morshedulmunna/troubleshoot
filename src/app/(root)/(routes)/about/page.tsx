						is best suited to solve the difficulty. Troubleshoot
						will offer the value-added feature to pre-screen a
						contractor when we are unable to perform the repair.
						This will develop a trust bond with the customer so that
						when a more minor issue comes up the customer is more
						likely to call us due to the honesty displayed earlier.
